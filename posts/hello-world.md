# Hello World!
> Welcome to my new blog

this is my new blog where i will document my struggles as a self-taught dev and whatnot


## Attemting to render code blocks
id like for my blog to be able to render code blocks with syntax highlighting

this will require me to pick a theme, _write some code_ and even make a git commit
```js
console.log("is this highlighted?")
```

## I will now attempt a list

1. this is
2. a numbered lis
3. it shoudl render
4. as a `<ul>`

- and this is a 
- bulleted list
- which should render
- as a `<ol>`

### This is achieved using `markdown-it`, `front-matter` and `markdow-it-prism` (for code highlighting)
